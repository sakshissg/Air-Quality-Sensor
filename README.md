Circuit Diagram

<h1>MQ 135 Sensor:</h1>
<p> The MQ-135 Gas sensor can detect gases like Ammonia (NH3), sulfur (S), Benzene (C6H6), CO2, and other harmful gases and smoke. Similar to other MQ series gas sensor, this sensor also has a digital and analog output pin. When the level of these gases go beyond a threshold limit in the air the digital pin goes high. </p>

<h2> MQ-135 Sensor Pinout </h2>

This sensor has 4 pins:

•	5V: Module power supply – 5 V

•	GND: Ground

•	DOUT: Digital output

•	AOUT: Analog output


<h3>Pin	Description</h3>

VCC	Positive power supply pin that powers up the sensor module.

GND	Reference potential pin.

AO	Analog output pin. It generates a signal proportional to the concentration of gas vapors coming in contact with the sensor.

DO	Digital Output pin. It also produces a digital signal whose limit can be set using the in-built potentiometer.
